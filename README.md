# ML-bank-transaction-grouping

This script can be used to categorize automatically your financial transactions
by using the power of machine learning.

However, this script will not solve your categorization problem "out-of-the-box".
Instead, it meant to work as a tutotrial, with you could do this by 
providing your training data and get a good insight about machine learing
while still solving a daily issue with your (probably) small amount of training data.
